Instructions for how to build the Lucene Database interface for the SRW/SRU server.

==Prerequisites==
  * Tomcat or some other servlet engine
  * Ant

==Step 1==
Download the latest Lucene Database interface from the SVN repository.  (Instructions for that can be found [http://code.google.com/p/oclcsrwlucene/source/checkout here].)

==Step 2==
Run "ant" to compile the code and build SRWLucene.jar.

==Step 3==
After you’ve run “ant”, you’ll find a directory named “dist” and in it you will find the SRWLucene.jar file. If you are building a new complete SRW server, then copy the jar file from the "dist" directory and the jars (except the SRW jar!) from the "lib" directory to the web/WEB-INF/lib directory of the SRW distribution.  If you are just updating an already deployed SRW server, then copy those same files to your `<tomcat>/webapps/<SRW>/WEB-INF/lib` directory.
